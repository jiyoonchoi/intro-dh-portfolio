## Reflection

In ["Topic Modeling: A Basic Introduction"](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-digital-humanities-by-david-m-blei/), author Megan R. Brett generalizes and details the basic concepts of topic modeling and its wide applications. According to Brett, topic modeling is one of the many ways to identify patterns in a corpus. The phrase "topic modeling" is fitting because this method is essentially identifying specific "topics" for potential further data analysis. 

In Brett's thorough explanation, I found her analogy of color-coding a text using highlighters particularly interesting. This analogy is an intuitive and very human textual analysis technique that most, if not all scholars have used in their studies over the years. Using physical highlighters for specific terms and groups as you sift through the material is what we've always done, but now with digital humanities methods like topic modeling, is that all ancient history? Was there ever any value in the gruesome process of manually highlighting and identifying patterns by hand if the ultimate end-goal was to analyze the <i>results</i>? 

As I continued reading, Brett delved into the cases in which one would want to use topic modeling in the first place. The first case was when one has a large corpus of text, preferably one that is over 1,000 documents worth of text. This specification makes more sense when looking back at my previous question of what the purpose of manual highlighting is when a tool like topic modeling exists. It isn't necessarily worth the time of setting up your corpus of text for topic modeling if it is a relatively short body of text. In that case, it's more beneficial to do it by hand.

When utilizing topic modeling on big texts, you're able to take these patterns and run them through data visualizers. However, it's important to note that one can essentially "visualize" any corpus. Generating a visualization of data that is interpretable to anybody at first glance is completely up to the person running the data analysis. The performed topic modeling has to line up with the project purpose in order for the results to be remotely valuable.
