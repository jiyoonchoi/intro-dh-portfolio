## Reflection
In my reflection, I'll be delving into a section I found interesting in William Drees' book "What are the Humanities for?". In it, he describes 
the way humans tend to study humans and experience the universal human condition. Drees poses the question, what even are the humanities? In doing so, he offers the tentative definition:

"Humanities are academic disciplines in which humans seek understanding of human self-understandings and self-expressions, and of the ways in which people thereby construct and experience the world they live in."

However, this definition is arguably still insufficient. Drees goes on to mention Martin Hollis' "The Philosophy of Social Science: An Introduction", where Hollis describes the two approaches understanding humanities: that humans are both agents and actors. I found this section of the reading particularly interesting because it was essentially the breakdown of human behavior in terms of being an agent who impacts their surrounding environment and an actor who impacts said surroundings with the context of intent and reason.

The idea that the foundation to humanities is how and why humans do what they do, and the eventual outcome, contributes even more layers to Drees' definition. I do still wonder what Hollis means by approaching the humanities by seeking out the meaning of action rather than the cause of behavior. What's really the difference between the two? Isn't our cause the same thing as our meaning and intent? Though typical causes of behavior are linked to the strict rules of social life as mentioned in the text, aren't those forces what daily influence our meaning of action? Regardless of such nuance, Drees summarizes his second-order analysis of the humanities as a subjective matter with the unlimited potential of evolving in its definition. His question of "Why do humans need humanities?" made me think, what's the purpose? Why are we so curious about our own complexities and how will our value for the humanities change as we approach the future? This is an idea I hope to continue to explore as we interpret these kinds of ideas using digital applications.
