## Reflection
In J. G. A. Pocock's “An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (2018), he thoroughly discusses his criticisms and reflection of Edward Gibbon's lengthy “The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” (1776-1789). Gibbon was an English Historian from the 18th century who made bold claims that the reason for the fall of the Roman Empire was the growing prominence of Christianity. He was a public critic of religion as a whole and strongly believed that it caused the people of the Roman Empire to lose their sense of nationalistic support and civic virtue for the empire as a state. 

Pocock goes on to criticize the validity of Gibbon's claims, pointing out 
the lack of evidence supporting his ideas. Despite the doubt of Gibbon's work in the humanities scholarly world, Pocock acknowledged Gibbon as an "early modern historian" in comparison to other historians during his time. It's interesting to see a historian from today communicate with one of so many years ago in a way that puts into question the legitimacy of much of what we know. If Gibbon's countless volumes of content were so criticized for insufficient information to back him up, what does that say of so many other works from that time or earlier on? Another question I want to pose is, regardless of whether or not scholars today mutually disagree with Gibbon, how many of their own works actually have some parallel ideas with his? Further, regardless of insufficient evidence on the actual connection between religion and the fall of the Roman Empire, is it valid based on the evidence on what <i>was</i> known of religion to claim that Christianity could've at least failed in protecting the imfamous decline? My real question is, if the lack of an agreed upon basis of supporting evidence for Gibbon's claims is the leading criticism of his work (besides his controversial animosity toward religion), what other leading criticisms could rise to greater importance for deciding the legitimacy of scholarship in future years? Rather, how could we determine the accuracy of historians' historiological viewpoints utilizing digital humanities?
