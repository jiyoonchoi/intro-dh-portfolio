    "Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing to extract subjective information from a textual corpus. It does so by attempting to quantify the emotional intensity of specific words and phrases in the text at hand. In other words, it uses quantitative methods to acquire qualitative data. In this example from the Programming Historian, sentiment analysis is used as the basis for an exploratory data analysis of a case study called \"the Enron E-mail Corpus\". Exploratory data analysis is essentially a strategy of summarizing or pointing out features of interest within a dataset which would otherwise likely be overlooked. The case study introduces the Enron scandal, where the company Enron was exposed for fraud and the Enron E-mail Corpus contained over 600,000 messages.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned a lot from this Programming Historian lesson and enjoyed playing around with VADER and word_tokenize, which are of the Natural Language Processing Tool Kit. The idea of sentiment analysis is a highly intuitive concept, and even in its practice I understand how to use the tools provided. Although I don't know the nitty-gritty complex code behind the scenes, as a client I can at least use NPTK appropriate to the scope of my own textual corpus. I found it especially interesting how sentiment analysis still has room to improve in terms of capturing the more complex quirks of human linguistics such as irony, sarcasm, and mockery. Regardless, it's a neat program that can be widely applied."
