## Evaluation

Enslaved.org is a digital database focused on increasing the visibility of the lives of African enslaved individuals throughout history. 
Since 2018, Enslaved.org has been a digital search engine tool for users to input the names of people, places, and events to accessibly learn more. When using this discovery hub, detailed accounts of enslaved people's stories (or, as detailed as they can be). 

What I find extremely interesting about this project is their full transparency.
