# Description

[Link to ArcGIS map](https://arcg.is/0zyjWS)

After Carolyn Talmadge came to speak in class, we created a demo WebMap visualizing the frequency of the city names mentioned in Chapter 5 of Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Following class, I created a similar WebMap but instead for Gibbon's Chapter 8. The size of each dark purple circle is proportionate to how frequently that city is mentioned in the chapter. This map additionally visualizes the road networks of the Roman Empire and the borders to the areas within the empire during 200 AD, which aligns with the timeline of Chapter 8.
